# 🎓 Campus Simulation Project

This is a JavaFX-based simulation project that models the dynamics of a university campus. Users can interact with the simulation by adding buildings, students, and professors, and visualize how different resources like water, electricity, and satisfaction evolve over time.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Interactive GUI built with JavaFX and FXML
- ✅ Add dynamic campus elements:
  - Libraries
  - Classrooms
  - Cafeterias
  - Students
  - Professors
- ✅ Real-time visual feedback:
  - Students and professors are shown as small icons
  - Buildings are represented with larger visuals
- ✅ Resource dashboard with live progress bars for:
  - Student satisfaction
  - Water usage
  - Space usage
  - Wi-Fi consumption
  - Electricity usage
- ✅ Modular and extensible architecture

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Java 22
- JavaFX 22
- FXML for UI layout
- SceneBuilder (optional for GUI design)
- IntelliJ IDEA for development
